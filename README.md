**M**anage l**ift** -> **mift** -> **miffed**

A silly project deserves a silly name

## Motivation 

To take something as quotidian and mundane as a lift, build a programme which models it and allows people to interact with it. 
This will almost certainly be useless to anyone else, but it will provide hours of fun for me. 

Some of the interesting opportunities I see:
- [ ] Building an application whose core revolves around long-lived processes
- [ ] Having fun with highly interactive client/server patterns, perhaps with full duplex communication
